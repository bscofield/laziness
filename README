Laziness
========

Laziness does one thing: if your application throws an unhandled error, it will automatically create a failing test for you to copy into the appropriate test file.


Example
=======

Say you're browsing your site and you get a 500 error on /users/new, which is rendering the UsersController#new action. In the error page (or exception email, if you're using ExceptionNotifier), Laziness adds something like the following:

def test_lazy_test_for_users_new_should_not_throw_nameerror_exception
  assert_nothing_raised(NameError) do
    get :new, {[params from request]}, {[session from request]}, {[flash from request]}, {[cookies from request]}
  end
end

The exact exception asserted (in this case, NameError) will depend on what caused the 500 error in the first place.
